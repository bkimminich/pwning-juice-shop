# :godmode: Appendix A - Challenge solutions

All URLs in the challenge solutions assume you are running the
application locally and on the default port http://localhost:3000.
Change the URL accordingly if you use a different root URL.

Often there are multiple ways to solve a challenge. In most cases just
one possible solution is presented here. This is typically the easiest
or most obvious one from the author's perspective.

_The challenge solutions found in this release of the companion guide
are compatible with {{book.juiceShopVersion}} of OWASP Juice Shop._

## Trivial Challenges (  :star:  )

### Access a confidential document

1. Follow the link to titled _Check out our boring terms of use if you
   are interested in such lame stuff_
   (<http://localhost:3000/ftp/legal.md?md_debug=true>) on the _About
   Us_ page.
2. Successfully attempt to browse the directory by changing the URL into
   <http://localhost:3000/ftp>

   ![FTP directory browser](img/ftp_directory.png)
3. Open <http://localhost:3000/ftp/acquisitions.md> to solve the
   challenge.

### Provoke an error that is not very gracefully handled.

Any request that cannot be properly handled by the server will
eventually be passed to a global error handling component that sends an
error page to the client that includes a stack trace and other sensitive
information. The restful API behaves in a similar way, passing back a
JSON error object with sensitive data, such as SQL query strings.

Here are two examples (out of many different ways) to provoke such an
error situation and solve this challenge immediately:

* Visit <http://localhost:3000/rest/qwertz>

  ![500 Error](img/error_page-500.png)
* Log in to the application with `'` (single-quote) as _Email_ and
  anything as _Password_

  ![Object Error in Login form](img/login-error_js.png)
  ![SQL error in JS console](img/error_js-console.png)

### Read our privacy policy

1. Log in to the application with any user.
2. Open the dropdown menu on your profile picture and choose _Privacy &
   Security_.
3. You will find yourself on
   <http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy> which
   instantly solves this challenge for you.

### Let us redirect you to a donation site that went out of business

1. Log in to the application with any user.
2. Visit the _Your Basket_ page and expand the _Payment_ and
   _Merchandise_ sections with the "credit card"-button.
3. Perceive that all donation links are passed through the `to`
   parameter of the route `/redirect`
4. Open `main.js` in your browser's DevTools
5. Searching for `/redirect?to=` and stepping through all matches you
   will notice one that does not appear on any (visible) button on the
   _Your Basket_ page: `/redirect?to=https://gratipay.com/juice-shop`

   ![Gratipay commented out](img/gratipay-button-ngIf_false.png)
6. Open
   <http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=https://gratipay.com/juice-shop>
   to solve the challenge.

### Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page

1. Go to the _Sources_ tab of your browsers DevTools and open the
   `main.js` file.
2. If your browser offers pretty-printing of this minified messy code,
   best use this offer. In Chrome this can be done with the "{}"-button.
3. Search for `score` and iterate through each finding to come across
   one that looks like a route mapping section:

   ![Route Mapping the the Score Board](/appendix/img/score-board_route.png)
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/score-board to solve the
   challenge.
5. From now on you will see the additional menu item _Score Board_ in
   the navigation bar.

### Perform a reflected XSS attack

1. Log in as any user.
2. Click the _Track Orders_ button.
3. Paste the attack string `<iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">` into
   the _Order ID_ field.
4. Click the _Track_ button.
5. An alert box with the text "xss" should appear.

   ![XSS alert box](img/xss0_alert.png)

### Perform a DOM XSS attack

1. Paste the attack string `<iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">` into
   the _Search..._ field.
2. Click the _Search_ button.
3. An alert box with the text "xss" should appear.

   ![XSS alert box](img/xss1_alert.png)

### Give a devastating zero-star feedback to the store

Place an order that makes you rich. Visit the _Contact Us_ form and put
in a _Comment_ text. Also solve the CAPTCHA at the bottom of the form.

1. The _Submit_ button is still **disabled** because you did not select
   a _Rating_ yet.
2. Inspect the _Submit_ button with your DevTools and note the
   `disabled` attribute of the `<button>` HTML tag
3. Double click on `disabled` attribute to select it and then delete it
   from the tag.

   ![Disabled Submit Button in Contact Us form](img/contact_disabled_submit-button.png)
4. The _Submit_ button is now **enabled**.
5. Click the _Submit_ button to solve the challenge.
6. You can verify the feedback was saved by checking the _Customer
   Feedback_ widget on the _About Us_ page.

   ![Zero star feedback in carousel](img/zero_star_feedback-carousel.png)

## Easy Challenges (  :star::star:  )

### Access the administration section of the store

:wrench: **TODO**

1. Open the `main.js` in your browser's developer tools and search for
   "admin".
2. One of the matches will be a route mapping to `path:
   "administration"`.

   ![Administration page route in main.js](img/minified_js-admin.png)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/administration to solve the
   challenge.

### View another user's shopping basket

1. Log in as any user.
2. Put some products into your shopping basket.
3. Inspect the _Session Storage_ in your browser's developer tools to
   find a numeric `bid` value.

   ![Basket ID in Session Storage](img/session_storage.png)
4. Change the `bid`, e.g. by adding or subtracting 1 from its value.
5. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/basket> to solve the challenge.

If the challenge is not immediately solved, you might have to
`F5`-reload to relay the `bid` change to the Angular client.

### Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down

1. Log in as any user.
2. Click _Complain?_ in the _Contact Us_ dropdown to go to the _File
   Complaint_ form
3. Clicking the file upload button for _Invoice_ and browsing some
   directories you might notice that `.pdf` and `.zip` files are
   filtered by default
4. Trying to upload another other file will probably give you an error
   message on the UI stating exactly that: `Forbidden file type. Only
   PDF, ZIP allowed.`
5. Open the `main.js` in your DevTools and find the declaration of the
   file upload (e.g. by searching for `zip`)
6. In the `allowedMimeType` array you will notice `"application/xml"`
   and `"text/xml"` along with the expected PDF and ZIP types

   ![Possible XML upload spoilered in main.js](img/complaint_xml_mime-type.png)
7. Click on the _Choose File_ button.
8. In the _File Name_ field enter `*.xml` and select any arbitrary XML
   file (<100KB) you have available. Then press _Open_.
9. Enter some _Message_ text and press _Submit_ to solve the challenge.
10. On the JavaScript Console of your browser you will see a suspicious
    `410 (Gone)` HTTP Error. In the corresponding entry in the Network
    section of your browser's DevTools, you should see an error message,
    telling you that `B2B customer complaints via file upload have been
    deprecated for security reasons!`

### Get rid of all 5-star customer feedback

1. Log in to the application with any user.
2. Solve
   [Access the administration section of the store](#access-the-administration-section-of-the-store)

   ![Feedback table on Administration page](img/customer_feedback-table.png)
3. Delete all entries with five star rating from the _Customer Feedback_
   table using the trashcan button

### Log in with the administrator's user account

* Log in with _Email_ `' or 1=1--` and any _Password_ which will
  authenticate the first entry in the `Users` table which coincidentally
  happens to be the administrator
* or log in with _Email_ `admin@juice-sh.op'--` and any _Password_ if
  you have already know the email address of the administrator
* or log in with _Email_ `admin@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `admin123`
  if you looked up the administrator's password hash
  `0192023a7bbd73250516f069df18b500` in a rainbow table after harvesting
  the user data
  * by solving
    [Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection](#retrieve-a-list-of-all-user-credentials-via-sql-injection)
  * or via REST API call <http://localhost:3000/api/Users> while
    providing any valid `Authorization Bearer` token (even one of a
    self-registered user).

### Log in with MC SafeSearch's original user credentials

1. Reading the hints for this challenge or googling "MC SafeSearch" will
   eventually bring the music video
   ["Protect Ya' Passwordz"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v59CX2DiX0Y)
   to your attention.
2. Watch this video to learn that MC used the name of his dog "Mr.
   Noodles" as a password but changed "some vowels into zeroes".
3. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/login> and log in with _Email_
   `mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `Mr. N00dles` to solve
   this challenge.

### Log in with the administrator's user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection

1. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/login>.
2. Log in with _Email_ `admin@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `admin123`
   which is as easy to guess as it is to brute force or retrieve from a
   rainbow table.

### Behave like any "white hat" should

1. Visit <https://securitytxt.org/> to learn about a proposed standard
   which allows websites to define security policies.
2. Request the security policy file from the server at
   <http://localhost:3000/.well-known/security.txt> to solve the
   challenge.
3. Optionally, write an email to the mentioned contact address
   <mailto:donotreply@owasp-juice.shop> and see what happens... :e-mail:

### Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does

Juice Shop uses some inappropriate crypto algorithms and libraries in
different places. While working on the following topics (and having the
`package.json.bak` at hand) you will learn those inappropriate choices
in order to exploit and solve them:

* [Forge a coupon code that gives you a discount of at least 80%](#forge-a-coupon-code-that-gives-you-a-discount-of-at-least-80)
  exploits `z85` (Zero-MQ Base85 implementation) as the library for
  coupon codes.
* [Solve challenge #999](#solve-challenge-999) requires you to create a
  valid hash with the `hashid` library.
* Passwords in the `Users` table are hashed with unsalted MD5
* Users registering via Google account will receive a very silly default
  password that involves Base64 encoding.

<!-- -->

1. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/contact>.
2. Submit your feedback with one of the following words in the comment:
   `z85`, `base85`, `base64`, `md5` or `hashid`.

### Perform an XSS attack on a legacy page within the application

1. Log in as any user.
2. Visit our user profile page at <http://localhost:3000/profile>.
3. Type in any _Username_ and click the _Set Username_ button.
4. Notice that the username is displayed beneath the profile image.
5. Change the username into `<script>alert('xss')</script>` and click
   _Set Username_.
6. Notice the displayed username under the profile picture now is
   `lert('xss')` while in the _Username_ field it shows
   `lert('xss')</script>` - both a clear indication that the malicious
   input was sanitized. Obviously the sanitization was not very
   sophisticated, as the input was quite mangled and even the closing
   `<script>` tag survived the procedure.
7. Change the username into `<<a|ascript>alert('xss')</script>` and
   click _Set Username_.
8. The naive sanitizer only removes `<a|a` effectively changing the
   username into `<script>alert('xss')</script>` thus resulting in the
   expected alert box popping up.

## Medium Challenges (  :star::star::star:  )

###  Get registered as admin user

1. Submit a `POST` request to <http://localhost:3000/api/Users> with:
   * `{"email":"admin","password":"admin","isAdmin":true}` as body
   * and `application/json` as `Content-Type`

   ![Admin user registration request via Postman](img/register-admin_postman.png)
2. Upon your next visit to the application's web UI the challenge will
   be marked as solved.

### Put an additional product into another user's shopping basket

1. Log in as any user.
2. Inspect HTTP traffic while putting items into your own shopping
   basket to learn your own `BasketId`. For this solution we assume
   yours is `1` and another user's basket with a `BasketId` of `2`
   exists.
3. Submit a `POST` request to <http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems>
   with payload as `{"ProductId": 14,"BasketId": "2","quantity": 1}`
   making sure no product of that with `ProductId` of `14` is already in
   the target basket. Make sure to supply your `Authorization Bearer`
   token in the request header.
4. You will receive a (probably unexpected) response of `{'error' :
   'Invalid BasketId'}` - after all, it is not your basket!
5. Change your `POST` request into utilizing HTTP Parameter Polution
   (HPP) by supplying your own `BasketId` _and_ that of someone else in
   the same payload, i.e. `{"ProductId": 14,"BasketId": "1","quantity":
   1,"BasketId": "2"}`.
6. Submitting this request will satisfy the validation based on your own
   `BasketId` but put the product into the other basket!

:information_source: With other `BasketId`s you might need to play with
the order of the duplicate property a bit and/or make sure your own
`BasketId` is lower than the one of the target basket to make this HPP
vulnerability work in your favor.

### Submit 10 or more customer feedbacks within 10 seconds

1. Open the Network tab of your browser DevTools and visit
   <http://localhost:3000/#/contact>
2. You should notice a `GET` request to
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/captcha/> which retrieves the CAPTCHA for
   the feedback form. The HTTP response body will look similar to
   `{"captchaId":18,"captcha":"5*8*8","answer":"320"}`.
3. Fill out the form normally and submit it while checking the backend
   interaction in your Developer Tools. The CAPTCHA identifier and
   solution are transmitted along with the feedback in the request body:
   `{comment: "Hello", rating: 1, captcha: "320", captchaId: 18}`
4. You will notice that a new CAPTCHA is retrieved from the REST
   endpoint. It will present a different math challenge, e.g.
   `{"captchaId":19,"captcha":"1*1-1","answer":"0"}`
5. Write another feedback but before sending it, change the `captchaId`
   and `captcha` parameters to the previous values of `captchaId` and
   `answer`. In this example you would submit `captcha: "320",
   captchaId: 18` instead of `captcha: "0", captchaId: 19`.
6. The server will accept your feedback, telling your that the CAPTCHA
   can be pinned to any previous one you like.
7. Write a script with a 10-iteration loop that submits feedback using
   your pinned `captchaId` and `captcha` parameters. Running this script
   will solve the challenge.

Two alternate (but more complex) solutions:
* Rewrite your script so that it _parses the response from each CAPTCHA
  retrieval call_ to <http://localhost:3000/rest/captcha/> and sets the
  extracted `captchaId` and `answer` parameters in each subsequent form
  submission as `captchaId` and `captcha`.
* Using an automated browser test tool like
  [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) you could do the
  following:
  1. Read the CAPTCHA question from the HTML element `<code id="captcha"
     ...>`
  2. Calculate the result on the fly using JavaScript
  3. Let WebDriver write the answer into the `<input
     name="feedbackCaptcha" ...>` field.

The latter is actually the way it is implemented in the end-to-end test
for this challenge:

```javascript
  let comment, rating, submitButton, captcha

  beforeEach(() => {
    browser.get('/#/contact')
    comment = element(by.id('comment'))
    rating = $$('.br-unit').last()
    captcha = element(by.id('captchaControl'))
    submitButton = element(by.id('submitButton'))
    solveNextCaptcha()
  })

  describe('challenge "captchaBypass"', () => {
    it('should be possible to post 10 or more customer feedbacks in less than 10 seconds', () => {
      for (var i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
        comment.sendKeys('Spam #' + i)
        rating.click()
        submitButton.click()
        browser.sleep(200)
        solveNextCaptcha() // first CAPTCHA was already solved in beforeEach
      }
    })

    protractor.expect.challengeSolved({ challenge: 'CAPTCHA Bypass Tier 1' })
  })

  function solveNextCaptcha () {
    element(by.id('captcha')).getText().then((text) => {
      const answer = eval(text).toString() // eslint-disable-line no-eval
      captcha.sendKeys(answer)
    })
  }
```

_It is worth noting that both alternate solutions would still work even
if the CAPTCHA-pinning problem would be fixed in the application!_

### Post some feedback in another users name

1. Go to the _Contact Us_ form on <http://localhost:3000/#/contact>.
2. Inspect the DOM of the form in your browser to spot this suspicious
   text field right at the top: `<input _ngcontent-c23 hidden
   id="userId" type="text" class="ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid">`

   ![Hidden text field on Contact Us form](img/hidden_textfield.png)
3. In your browser's developer tools remove the `hidden` attribute from
   above `<input>` tag.

   ![Spoofed feedback ready for submit](img/spoofed_feedback.png)
4. The field should now be visible in your browser. Type any user's
   database identifier in there (other than your own if you are
   currently logged in) and submit the feedback.

You can also solve this challenge by directly sending a `POST` to
<http://localhost:3000/api/Feedbacks> endpoint. You could for example be
logged out but provide any `UserId` in the JSON payload.

### Post a product review as another user or edit any user's existing review

:wrench: **TODO**

### Access a salesman's forgotten backup file

1. Browse to <http://localhost:3000/ftp> (like in
   [Access a confidential document](#access-a-confidential-document).
2. Opening <http://localhost:3000/ftp/coupons_2013.md.bak> directly will
   fail complaining about an illegal file type.
3. Exploit a bug in the `md_debug` parameter that was obviously not
   supposed to go into production to bypass the filter and solve the
   challenge:
   <http://localhost:3000/ftp/coupons_2013.md.bak?md_debug=.md>

Alternatively this challenge can also be solved via _Poison Null Byte_
injection as in
[Access a developer's forgotten backup file](#access-a-developers-forgotten-backup-file).

### Log in with Amy's original user credentials

1. Google for either `93.83 billion trillion trillion centuries` or `One
   Important Final Note`.
2. Both searches should show <https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm> as one
   of the top hits.
3. After reading up on _Password Padding_ try the example password
   `D0g.....................`
4. She actually did a very similar padding trick, just with the name of
   her husband _Kif_ written as _K1f_ instead of _D0g_ from the example!
   She did not even bother changing the padding length!
5. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/login> and log in with credentials
   `amy@juice-sh.op` and password `K1f.....................` to solve
   the challenge

### Log in with Bender's user account

* Log in with _Email_ `bender@juice-sh.op'--` and any _Password_ if you
  have already know Bender's email address.
* A rainbow table attack on Bender's password will probably fail as it
  is rather strong. You can alternatively solve
  [Change Bender's password into _slurmCl4ssic_ without using SQL Injection or Forgot Password](#change-benders-password-into-slurmcl4ssic-without-using-sql-injection-or-forgot-password)
  first and then simply log in with the new password.

### Log in with Jim's user account

* Log in with _Email_ `jim@juice-sh.op'--` and any _Password_ if you
  have already know Jim's email address.
* or log in with _Email_ `jim@juice-sh.op` and _Password_ `ncc-1701` if
  you looked up Jim's password hash in a rainbow table after harvesting
  the user data as described in
  [Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection](#retrieve-a-list-of-all-user-credentials-via-sql-injection).

### Place an order that makes you rich

1. Log in as any user.
2. Put at least one item into your shopping basket.
3. Note that reducing the quantity of a basket item below 1 is not
   possible via the UI
4. When changing the quantity via the UI, you will notice `PUT` requests
   to <http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems/{id}> in the Network tab of
   your DevTools
5. Memorize the `{id}` of any item in your basket
6. Copy your `Authorization` header from any HTTP request submitted via
   browser.
7. Submit a `PUT` request to
   <http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems/{id}> replacing `{id}` with
   the memorized number from 5. and with:
   * `{"quantity": -100}` as body,
   * `application/json` as `Content-Type`
   * and `Bearer ?` as `Authorization` header, replacing the `?` with
     the token you copied from the browser.

   ![Negative quantity request body in PostMan](img/negative_order_postman-body.png)
8. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/basket> to view _Your Basket_ with the
   negative quantity on the first item

   ![Basket with negative item quantity](img/negative_order-basket.png)
9. Click _Checkout_ to issue the negative order and solve this
   challenge.

   ![Order confirmation with negative total](img/negative_order_pdf.pdf.png)

### Prove that you actually read our privacy policy

1. Open <http://localhost:3000/#/privacy-security/privacy-policy>.
2. Moving your mouse cursor over each paragraph will make a fire-effect
   appear on certain words or partial sentences.

   ![Hot section in the privacy policy](img/privacy-policy_hot-section.png)
3. Inspect the HTML in your browser and note down all text inside `<span
   class="hot">` tags, which are `http://localhost`, `We may also`,
   `instruct you`, `to refuse all`, `reasonably necessary` and
   `responsibility`.
4. Combine those into the URL
   <http://localhost:3000/we/may/also/instruct/you/to/refuse/all/reasonably/necessary/responsibility>
   (adding the server port if needed) and solve the challenge by
   visiting it.

It seems the Juice Shop team did not appreciate your extensive reading
effort enough to provide even a tiny gratification, as you will receive
only a `404 Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat
'/app/frontend/dist/frontend/assets/private/thank-you.jpg'`.

### Change the href of the link within the O-Saft product description

1. By searching for _O-Saft_ directly via the REST API with
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/product/search?q=o-saft> you will learn
   that it's database ID is `9`.
2. Submit a `PUT` request to <http://localhost:3000/api/Products/9>
   with:
   * `{"description": "<a href=\"http://kimminich.de\"
     target=\"_blank\">More...</a>"}` as body
   * and `application/json` as `Content-Type`

   ![O-Saft link update via PostMan](img/osaft_postman-body.png)

### Reset the password of Bjoern's OWASP account via the Forgot Password mechanism

1. Find Bjoern's
   [_OWASP Juice Shop_ playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV9O4rIovHhO1y8_78GZfMbH6oznyx2g2)
2. Watch
   [BeNeLux Day 2018: Juice Shop: OWASP's Most Broken Flagship - Björn Kimminich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu0-kDdtVf4)
3. This conference talk recording immediately dives into a demo of the
   Juice Shop application in which Bjoern starts registering a new
   account 3:59 into the video (<https://youtu.be/Lu0-kDdtVf4?t=239>)
4. Bjoern picks _Name of your favorite pet?_ as his security question
   and - live on camera - answers it truthfully with "Zaya", the name of
   his family's adorable three-legged cat.
5. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password> and provide
   `bjoern@owasp.org` as your _Email_.
6. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `Zaya` as _Name of your
   favorite pet?_
7. Then type any _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_
8. Click _Change_ to solve this challenge

#### Other hints about Bjoern's choice of security answer

The **user profile picture** of his account at
<http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/13.jpg> shows his
pet cat playing.

![Zaya playing](img/zaya.jpg)

Furthermore, on Bjoern's **Patreon page** at
<https://www.patreon.com/bkimminich> there is a locked post titled
"Behind the scenes: Photo-bombed by Zaya" and tagged with the keyword
"cat" which spoilers the pet's name.

![Locked Patreon post mentioning Zaya](img/patreon_locked-post.png)

Unlocking the post (by becoming a project patron) is not even necessary,
but it would confirm the identity of the cat when comparing it with the
user profile picture from before.

![Unlocked Patreon post mentioning Zaya](img/patreon_unlocked-post.png)

### Reset Jim's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
   `jim@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_ to learn that _Your eldest siblings
   middle name?_ is Jim's chosen security question
2. Jim (whose `UserId` happens to be `2`) left some breadcrumbs in the
   application which reveal his identity
   * A product review for the _OWASP Juice Shop-CTF Velcro Patch_
     stating _"Looks so much better on my uniform than the boring
     Starfleet symbol."_
   * Another product review _"Fresh out of a replicator."_ on the _Green
     Smoothie_ product
   * A _Recycling Request_ with the address _"Starfleet HQ, 24-593
     Federation Drive, San Francisco, CA"_ (:wrench: **TODO**)
3. It should eventually become obvious that _James T. Kirk_ is the only
   viable solution to the question of Jim's identity

   ![James T. Kirk](img/Star_Trek_William_Shatner.JPG)
4. Visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk and read the
   [Depiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk#Depiction)
   section
5. It tells you that Jim has a brother named _George Samuel Kirk_
6. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
   `jim@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_
7. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `Samuel` as _Your eldest
   siblings middle name?_
8. Then type any _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_
9. Click _Change_ to solve this challenge

   ![Password reset for Jim](img/jim_forgot-password.png)

### Upload a file larger than 100 kB

1. The client-side validation prevents uploads larger than 100 kB.
2. Craft a `POST` request to <http://localhost:3000/file-upload> with a
   form parameter `file` that contains a PDF file of more than 100 kB
   but less than 200 kB.

   ![Larger file upload](img/invalid-size_upload.png)
3. The response from the server will be a `204` with no content, but the
   challenge will be successfully solved.

Files larger than 200 kB are rejected by an upload size check on server
side with a `500` error stating `Error: File too large`.

### Upload a file that has no .pdf extension

1. Craft a `POST` request to <http://localhost:3000/file-upload> with a
   form parameter `file` that contains a non-PDF file with a size of
   less than 200 kB.

   ![Non-PDF upload](img/invalid-type_upload.png)
2. The response from the server will be a `204` with no content, but the
   challenge will be successfully solved.

Uploading a non-PDF file larger than 100 kB will solve
[Upload a file larger than 100 kB](#upload-a-file-larger-than-100-kb)
simultaneously.

### Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a client-side security mechanism

1. Submit a POST request to http://localhost:3000/api/Users with
   * `{"email": "<iframe src=\"javascript:alert('xss')\">", "password":
     "xss"}` as body
   * and `application/json` as `Content-Type` header.

   ![XSS request in PostMan](img/xss2_postman.png)
2. Log in to the application with any user.
3. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/administration.
4. An alert box with the text "xss" should appear.

   ![XSS alert box](img/xss2_alert.png)
5. Close this box. Notice the somewhat broken looking row in the
   _Registered Users_ table?
6. Click the "eye"-button in that row.
7. A modal overlay dialog with the user details opens where the attack
   string is rendered as harmless text.

   ![XSS user in details dialog](img/xss2_user-modal.png)

### Perform a persisted XSS attack without using the frontend application at all

1. Log in to the application with any user.
2. Copy your `Authorization` header from any HTTP request submitted via
   browser.
3. Submit a POST request to <http://localhost:3000/api/Products> with
   * `{"name": "XSS", "description": "<iframe
     src=\"javascript:alert('xss')\">", "price": 47.11}` as body,
   * `application/json` as `Content-Type`
   * and `Bearer ?` as `Authorization` header, replacing the `?` with
     the token you copied from the browser.

   ![XSS request in PostMan](img/xss3_postman.png)
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/search.
5. An alert box with the text "xss" should appear.

   ![XSS alert box](img/xss3_alert.png)
6. Close this box. Notice the product row which has a frame border in
   the description in the _All Products_ table
7. Click the "eye"-button next to that row.
8. Another alert box with the text "xss" should appear. After closing it
   the actual details dialog pops up showing the same frame border.

   ![After closing the XSS alert box in product details](img/xss3_product-modal_alert.png)

### Retrieve the content of C:\Windows\system.ini or /etc/passwd from the server

1. Solve the
   [Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down](#use-a-deprecated-b2b-interface-that-was-not-properly-shut-down)
   challenge.
2. Prepare an XML file which defines and uses an external entity
   `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>` (or `<!ENTITY xxe
   SYSTEM "file:///C:/Windows/system.ini" >]>` on Windows).
3. Upload this file through the _File Complaint_ dialog and observe the
   Javascript console while doing so. It should give you an error
   message containing the parsed XML, including the contents of the
   local system file!

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
        <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>

<trades>
    <metadata>
        <name>Apple Juice</name>
        <trader>

```

## Hard Challenges (  :star::star::star::star:  )

### Gain access to any access log file of the server

1. Solve the
   [Access a confidential document](#access-a-confidential-document) or
   any related challenges which will bring the exposed `/ftp` folder to
   your attention.
2. Visit <http://localhost:3000/ftp> and notice the file
   `incident-support.kdbx` which is needed for
   [Log in with the support team's original user credentials](../part2/security-misconfiguration.md#log-in-with-the-support-teams-original-user-credentials)
   and indicates that some support team is performing its duties from
   the public Internet and possibly with VPN access.
3. Guess luckily or run a brute force attack with e.g.
   [OWASP ZAPs DirBuster plugin](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/tree/beta/src/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/bruteforce)
   for a possibly exposed directory containing the log files.
4. Following
   [the hint to drill down deeper than one level](../part2/sensitive-data-exposure.md#gain-access-to-any-access-log-file-of-the-server),
   you will at some point end up with
   <http://localhost:3000/support/logs>.
5. Inside you will find at least one `access.log` of the current day.
   Open or download it to solve this challenge.

   ![Exposed folder containing access logs](img/access-log_folder.png)

### Order the Christmas special offer of 2014

1. Open http://localhost:3000/#/search and reload the page with `F5`
   while observing the _Network_ tab in your browser's DevTools
2. Recognize the `GET` request
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/product/search?q=> which returns the
   product data.
3. Submitting any SQL payloads via the _Search_ field in the navigation
   bar will do you no good, as it is only applying filters onto the
   entire data set what was retrieved with a singular call upon loading
   the page.
4. In that light, the `q=` parameter on the
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/product/search> endpoint would not even
   be needed, but might be a relic from a different implementation of
   the search functionality. Test this theory by submitting
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/product/searchq=orange> which should give
   you a result such as

   ![JSON search result for "orange" keyword](img/search-result_orange.png)
5. Submit `';` as `q` via
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/product/search?q=';>
6. You will receive an error page with a `SQLITE_ERROR: syntax error`
   mentioned, indicating that SQL Injection is indeed possible.

   ![SQL search query syntax error](img/search-error_sql-syntax.png)
7. You are now in the area of Blind SQL Injection, where trying create
   valid queries is a matter of patience, observance and a bit of luck.
8. Varying the payload into `'--` for `q` results in a `SQLITE_ERROR:
   incomplete input`. This error happens due to two (now unbalanced)
   parenthesis in the query.
9. Using `'))--` for `q` fixes the syntax and successfully retrieves all
   products, including the (logically deleted) Christmas offer. Take
   note of its `id` (which should be `10`)

   ![JSON search result with the Christmas special](img/search-result_christmas.png)
10. Go to <http://localhost:3000/#/login> and log in as any user.
11. Add any regularly available product into you shopping basket to
    prevent problems at checkout later. Memorize your `BasketId` value
    in the request payload (when viewing the Network tab) or find the
    same information in the `bid` variable in your browser's Session
    Storage (in the Application tab).
12. Craft and send a `POST` request to
    <http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems> with
    * `{"BasketId": "<Your Basket ID>", "ProductId": 10, "quantity": 1}`
      as body
    * and `application/json` as `Content-Type`
13. Go to <http://localhost:3000/#/basket> to verify that the "Christmas
    Super-Surprise-Box (2014 Edition)" is in the basket
14. Click _Checkout_ on the _Your Basket_ page to solve the challenge.

#### Alternative path without any SQL Injection

This solution involves a lot less hacking & sophistication but requires
more attention & a good portion of shrewdness.

1. Retrieve all products as JSON by calling
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/product/search?q=>
2. Write down all `id`s that are _missing_ in the otherwise sequential
   numeric range
3. Perform step 12. and 13. from above solution for all those missing
   `id`s
4. Once you hit the "Christmas Super-Surprise-Box (2014 Edition)" click
   _Checkout_ for instant success!

### Identify an unsafe product that was removed from the shop and inform the shop which ingredients are dangerous

:wrench: **TODO**

### Find the hidden easter egg

1. Use the _Poison Null Byte_ attack described in
   [Access a developer's forgotten backup file](#access-a-developers-forgotten-backup-file)...
2. ...to download <http://localhost:3000/ftp/eastere.gg%2500.md>

### Apply some advanced cryptanalysis to find the real easter egg

1. Get the encrypted string from the `eastere.gg` from the
   [Find the hidden easter egg](#find-the-hidden-easter-egg) challenge:
   `L2d1ci9xcmlmL25lci9mYi9zaGFhbC9ndXJsL3V2cS9uYS9ybmZncmUvcnR0L2p2Z3V2YS9ndXIvcm5mZ3JlL3J0dA==`
2. Base64-decode this into
   `/gur/qrif/ner/fb/shaal/gurl/uvq/na/rnfgre/rtt/jvguva/gur/rnfgre/rtt`
3. Trying this as a URL will not work. Notice the recurring patterns
   (`rtt`, `gur` etc.) in the above string
4. ROT13-decode this into
   `/the/devs/are/so/funny/they/hid/an/easter/egg/within/the/easter/egg`
5. Visit
   <http://localhost:3000/the/devs/are/so/funny/they/hid/an/easter/egg/within/the/easter/egg>

   ![Planet Orangeuze](img/planet_orangeuze.png)
6. Marvel at _the real_ easter egg: An interactive 3D scene of _Planet
   Orangeuze_!

### Access a developer's forgotten backup file

1. Browse to <http://localhost:3000/ftp> (like in
   [Access a confidential document](#access-a-confidential-document).
2. Opening <http://localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak> directly will
   fail complaining about an illegal file type.
3. Exploiting the `md_debug` parameter like in
   [Access a salesman's forgotten backup file](#access-a-salesmans-forgotten-backup-file)
   will not work here - probably because `package.json.bak` is not a
   Markdown file.
4. Using a _Poison Null Byte_ (`%00`) the filter can be tricked, but
   only with a twist:
   * Accessing <http://localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak%00.md> will
     surprisingly **not** succeed...
   * ...because the `%` character needs to be URL-encoded (into `%25`)
     as well in order to work its magic later during the file system
     access.
5. <http://localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md> will ultimately
   solve the challenge.

### Log in with Bjoern's Gmail account

1. Bjoern has registered via Google OAuth with his (real) account
   <bjoern.kimminich@googlemail.com>.
2. Cracking his password hash will probably not work.
3. To find out how the OAuth registration and login work, inspect the
   `main.js` and search for `oauth`, which will eventually reveal a
   function `userService.oauthLogin()`.

   ![oauthLogin function in main.js](img/minified_js-oauth.png)
4. In the function body you will notice a call to `userService.save()` -
   which is used to create a user account in the non-Google _User
   Registration_ process - followed by a call to the regular
   `userService.login()`
5. The `save()` and `login()` function calls both leak how the password
   for the account is set: `password:
   btoa(n.email.split("").reverse().join(""))`
6. Some Internet search will reveal that `window.btoa()` is a default
   function to encode strings into Base64.
7. What is passed into `btoa()` is `email.split("").reverse().join("")`,
   which is simply the email address string reversed.
8. Now all you have to do is Base64-encode
   `moc.liamelgoog@hcinimmik.nreojb`, so you can log in directly with
   _Email_ `bjoern.kimminich@googlemail.com` and _Password_
   `bW9jLmxpYW1lbGdvb2dAaGNpbmltbWlrLm5yZW9qYg==`.

### Find an old Recycle request and inform the shop about its unusual address

:wrench: **TODO**

### Access a misplaced SIEM signature file

1. Use the _Poison Null Byte_ attack described in
   [Access a developer's forgotten backup file](#access-a-developers-forgotten-backup-file)...
2. ...to download
   <http://localhost:3000/ftp/suspicious_errors.yml%2500.md>

### Let the server sleep for some time

1. You can interact with the backend API for product reviews via the
   dedicated endpoints `/rest/product/reviews` and
   `/rest/product/{id}/reviews`
2. Get the reviews of the product with database ID 1:
   http://localhost:3000/rest/product/1/reviews
3. Inject a
   [`sleep(integer ms)` command](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sleep/)
   by changing the URL into
   http://localhost:3000/rest/product/sleep(2000)/reviews to solve the
   challenge

To avoid _real_ Denial-of-Service (DoS) issues, the Juice Shop will only
wait for a maximum of 2 seconds, so
http://localhost:3000/rest/product/sleep(999999)/reviews should not take
longer than http://localhost:3000/rest/product/sleep(2000)/reviews to
respond.

### Update multiple product reviews at the same time

1. Log in as any user to get your `Authorization` token from any
   subsequent request's headers.
2. Submit a PATCH request to http://localhost:3000/rest/product/reviews
   with
   * `{ "id": { "$ne": -1 }, "message": "NoSQL Injection!" }` as body
   * `application/json` as `Content-Type` header.
   * and `Bearer ?` as `Authorization` header, replacing the `?` with
     the token you received in step 1.

   ![Multiple review updated via NoSQL Injection](img/nosql_multiple-reviews-updated.png)
3. Check different product detail dialogs to verify that _all review
   texts_ have been changed into `NoSQL Injection!`

### Wherever you go, there you are

1. Pick one of the redirect links in the application, e.g.
   <http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop>
   from the _GitHub_-button in the navigation bar.
2. Trying to redirect to some unrecognized URL fails due to whitelist
   validation with `406 Error: Unrecognized target URL for redirect`.
3. Removing the `to` parameter (<http://localhost:3000/redirect>) will
   instead yield a `500 TypeError: Cannot read property 'indexOf' of
   undefined` where the `indexOf` indicates a severe flaw in the way the
   whitelist works.
4. Craft a redirect URL so that the target-URL in `to` comes with an own
   parameter containing a URL from the whitelist, e.g.
   <http://localhost:3000/redirect?to=http://kimminich.de?pwned=https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop>

### Reset Bender's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

1. Trying to find out who "Bender" might be should _immediately_ lead
   you to _Bender from [Futurama](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/)_
   as the only viable option

   ![Bender](img/Bender_Rodriguez.png)
2. Visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama) and read the
   _Character Biography_ section
3. It tells you that Bender had a job at the metalworking factory,
   bending steel girders for the construction of _suicide booths_.
4. Find out more on _Suicide Booths_ on
   http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Suicide_booth
5. This site tells you that their most important brand is _Stop'n'Drop_
6. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
   `bender@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_
7. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `Stop'n'Drop` as _Company
   you first work for as an adult?_
8. Then type any _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_
9. Click _Change_ to solve this challenge

### Rat out a notorious character hiding in plain sight in the shop

1. Looking for irregularities among the image files you will at some
   point notice that `5.png` is the only PNG file among otherwise only
   JPGs in the customer feedback carousel:

   ![Steganography customer support image](img/steganography.png)
2. Running this image through some decoders available online will
   probably just return garbage, e.g.
   <http://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/> gives you `ÿÁÿm¶Û$ÿ
   ?HÕPü^ÛN'c±UY;fäHÜmÉ#r<v¸` or
   <https://www.mobilefish.com/services/steganography/steganography.php>
   gives up with `No hidden message or file found in the image`. On
   <https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide> you will also
   find nothing independent of how you set the _Hidden bits_ slider:

   ![Steganography unhiding fails](img/steganography_failed-unhide.png)
3. Moving on to client applications you might end up with
   [OpenStego](https://www.openstego.com/) which is built in Java but
   also offers a Windows installer at
   <https://github.com/syvaidya/openstego/releases>.
4. Selecting the `5.png` and clicking _Extract Data_ OpenStego will
   quickly claim to have been successful:

   ![Steganography exctraction successful](img/steganography_openstego-success.png)
5. The image that will be put into the _Output Stego file_ location
   clearly depicts a pixelated version of
   [Pickle Rick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickle_Rick) (from S3E3 -
   one of the best
   [Rick & Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty) episodes
   ever)

   ![Pickle Rick unveiled](img/steganography_pickle-rick.png)
6. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/contact>
7. Submit your feedback containing the name `Pickle Rick` (case doesn't
   matter) to solve this challenge.

### Inform the shop about a typosquatting trick it has become victim of

1. Solve the
   [Access a developer's forgotten backup file](#access-a-developers-forgotten-backup-file)
   challenge and open the `package.json.bak` file
2. Scrutinizing each entry in the `dependencies` list you will at some
   point get to `epilogue-js`, the overview page of which gives away
   that you find the culprit at
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/epilogue-js

   ![epilogue-js on NPM](img/npm_epilogue-js.png)
3. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/contact>
4. Submit your feedback with `epilogue-js` in the comment to solve this
   challenge

You can probably imagine that the typosquatted `epilogue-js` would be _a
lot harder_ to distinguish from the original repository `epilogue`, if
it where not marked with the _THIS IS **NOT** THE MODULE YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR!_-warning at the very top. Below you can see the original `epilogue`
NPM page:

![epilogue on NPM](img/npm_epilogue.png)

### Retrieve a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection

1. During the
   [Order the Christmas special offer of 2014](#order-the-christmas-special-offer-of-2014)
   challenge you learned that the `/rest/product/search` endpoint is
   susceptible to SQL Injection into the `q` parameter.
2. The attack payload you need to craft is a `UNION SELECT` merging the
   data from the user's DB table into the products returned in the JSON
   result.
3. As a starting point we use the known working `'))--` attack pattern
   and try to make a `UNION SELECT` out of it
4. Searching for `')) UNION SELECT * FROM x--` fails with a
   `SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: x` as you would expect. But we can
   easily guess the table name or infer it from one of the previous
   attacks on the _Login_ form where even the underlying SQL query was
   leaked.
5. Searching for `')) UNION SELECT * FROM Users--` fails with a
   promising `SQLITE_ERROR: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do
   not have the same number of result columns` which least confirms the
   table name.
6. The next step in a `UNION SELECT`-attack is typically to find the
   right number of returned columns. As the _Search Results_ table in
   the UI has 3 columns displaying data, it will probably at least be
   three. You keep adding columns until no more `SQLITE_ERROR` occurs
   (or at least it becomes a different one):

   1. `')) UNION SELECT '1' FROM Users--` fails with `number of result
      columns` error
   2. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2' FROM Users--` fails with `number of
      result columns` error
   3. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3' FROM Users--` fails with `number
      of result columns` error
   4. (...)
   5. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7' FROM Users--`
      _still fails_ with `number of result columns` error
   6. `')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8' FROM
      Users--` finally gives you a JSON response back with an extra
      element
      `{"id":"1","name":"2","description":"3","price":"4","image":"5","createdAt":"6","updatedAt":"7","deletedAt":"8"}`.

7. Next you get rid of the unwanted product results changing the query
   into something like `qwert')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5',
   '6', '7', '8' FROM Users--` leaving only the "`UNION`ed" element in
   the result set
8. The last step is to replace the fixed values with correct column
   names. You could guess those **or** derive them from the RESTful API
   results **or** remember them from previously seen SQL errors while
   attacking the _Login_ form.
9. Searching for `qwert')) UNION SELECT '1', id, email, password, '5',
   '6', '7', '8' FROM Users--` solves the challenge giving you a the
   list of all user data in convenient JSON format.

   ![User list from UNION SELECT attack](img/union_select-attack_result.png)

There is of course a much easier way to retrieve a list of all users as
long as you are logged in: Open <http://localhost:3000/#/administration>
while monitoring the HTTP calls in your browser's developer tools. The
response to <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/authentication-details>
also contains the user data in JSON format. But: This list has all the
password hashes replaced with `*`-symbols, so it does not count as a
solution for this challenge.

### Inform the shop about a vulnerable library it is using

Juice Shop depends on a JavaScript library with known vulnerabilities.
Having the `package.json.bak` and using an online vulnerability database
like [Retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/) or
[Snyk](https://snyk.io/vuln) makes it rather easy to identify it.

   [Access a developer's forgotten backup file](../part2/roll-your-own-security.md#access-a-developers-forgotten-backup-file)
2. Checking the dependencies in `package.json.bak` for known
   vulnerabilities online will give you a match (at least) for
   * `sanitize-html`: Sanitization of HTML strings is not applied

### Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a server-side security mechanism

In the `package.json.bak` you might have noticed the pinned dependency
`"sanitize-html": "1.4.2"`. Internet research will yield a reported
[Cross-site Scripting (XSS)](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:sanitize-html:20160801)
vulnerability, which was fixed with version 1.4.3 - one release later
than used by the Juice Shop. The referenced
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/punkave/sanitize-html/issues/29)
explains the problem and gives an exploit example:

> Sanitization is not applied recursively, leading to a vulnerability to
> certain masking attacks. Example:
>
> `I am not harmless: <<img src="csrf-attack"/>img src="csrf-attack"/>`
> is sanitized to `I am not harmless: <img src="csrf-attack"/>`
>
> Mitigation: Run sanitization recursively until the input html matches
> the output html.

## Dreadful Challenges (  :star::star::star::star::star:  )

### Learn about the Token Sale before its official announcement

1. Open the `main.js` in your browser's developer tools and search for
   some keywords like "ico", "token", "bitcoin" or "altcoin".
2. Note the names of the JavaScript functions where these occur in, like
   `Vu()` and `Hu(l)`. These names are obfuscated, so they might be
   different for you.

   ![Obfuscated token sale related functions in main.js](img/minified_js-tokensale.png)
3. Searching for references to those functions in `main.js` might yield
   some more functions, like `zu(l)` and some possible route name
   `app-token-sale`

   ![More token sale related functions in main.js](img/minified_js-tokensale_trail.png)
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000/#/app-token-sale> or variations
   like <http://localhost:3000/#/token-sale> just to realize that these
   routes do not exist.
5. After some more chasing through the minified code, you should realize
   that `Vu` is referenced in the route mappings that already helped
   with
   [Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page](#find-the-carefully-hidden-score-board-page)
   and
   [Access the administration section of the store](#access-the-administration-section-of-the-store)
   but not to a static title. It is mapped to another variable `Ca`
   (which might be named differently for you)

   ![Tokensale route mapping in main.js](img/minified_js-tokensale_route.png)
6. Search for `function Ca(` to find the declaration of the function
   that should return a matcher to the route name you are looking for.

   ![Tokensale route matcher in main.js](img/minified_js-tokensale_matcher.png)
7. Copy the obfuscating function into the JavaScript console of your
   browser and execute it immediately by appending a `()`. This will
   probably yield a `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )`. When you
   pass values in, like `(1)` or `('a')` you will notice that the input
   value is simply returned.
8. Comparing the route mapping to others shows you that here a `matcher`
   is mapped to a `component` whereas most other mappings map a `path`
   to their `component`.
9. The code that gives you the sought-after path is the code block
   passed into the `match()` function inside `Ca(l)`!

   ![Code block returning the Tokensale path](img/minified_js-tokensale_path-block.png)
10. Copying that inner code block and executing that in your console
    will still yield an error!
11. You need to append it to a string to make it work, which will
    **finally** yield the path `/tokensale-ico-ea`.
12. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000/#/tokensale-ico-ea> to solve this
    challenge.

```javascript
"" + function() {
                for (var l = [], n = 0; n < arguments.length; n++)
                    l[n] = arguments[n];
                var e = Array.prototype.slice.call(l)
                  , t = e.shift();
                return e.reverse().map(function(l, n) {
                    return String.fromCharCode(l - t - 45 - n)
                }).join("")
            }(25, 184, 174, 179, 182, 186) + 36669..toString(36).toLowerCase() + function() {
                for (var l = [], n = 0; n < arguments.length; n++)
                    l[n] = arguments[n];
                var e = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
                  , t = e.shift();
                return e.reverse().map(function(l, n) {
                    return String.fromCharCode(l - t - 24 - n)
                }).join("")

### Change Bender's password into slurmCl4ssic without using SQL Injection or Forgot Password

1. Log in as anyone.
2. Inspecting the backend HTTP calls of the _Password Change_ form
   reveals that these happen via `HTTP GET` and submits current and new
   password in clear text.
3. Probe the responses of `/rest/user/change-password` on various
   inputs:
   * <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A> yields
     a `401` error saying `Password cannot be empty.`
   * <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A&new=B>
     yields a `401` error saying `New and repeated password do not
     match.`
   * <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A&new=B&repeat=C>
     also says `New and repeated password do not match.`
   * <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=A&new=B&repeat=B>
     says `Current password is not correct.`
   * <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=B&repeat=B>
     yields a `200` success returning the updated user as JSON!
4. Now
   [Log in with Bender's user account](#log-in-with-benders-user-account)
   using SQL Injection.
5. Craft a GET request with Bender's `Authorization Bearer` header to
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=slurmCl4ssic&repeat=slurmCl4ssic>
   to solve the challenge.

   ![CSRF-like request via PostMan](img/csrf_postman.png)

#### Bonus Round: Cross Site Request Forgery

If you want to craft an actual CSRF attack against
`/rest/user/change-password` you will have to invest a bit extra work,
because a simple attack like _Search_ for `<img
src="http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=slurmCl4ssic&repeat=slurmCl4ssic">`
will not work. Making someone click on the corresponding attack link
<http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cimg%20src%3D%22http:%2F%2Flocalhost:3000%2Frest%2Fuser%2Fchange-password%3Fnew%3DslurmCl4ssic%26repeat%3DslurmCl4ssic%22%3E>
will return a `500` error when loading the image URL with a message
clearly stating that your attack ran against a security-wall: `Error:
Blocked illegal activity`

To make this exploit work, some more sophisticated attack URL is
required:

<http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Ciframe%20src%3D%22javascript%3Axmlhttp%20%3D%20new%20XMLHttpRequest%28%29%3B%20xmlhttp.open%28%27GET%27%2C%20%27http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Frest%2Fuser%2Fchange-password%3Fnew%3DslurmCl4ssic%26amp%3Brepeat%3DslurmCl4ssic%27%29%3B%20xmlhttp.setRequestHeader%28%27Authorization%27%2C%60Bearer%3D%24%7BlocalStorage.getItem%28%27token%27%29%7D%60%29%3B%20xmlhttp.send%28%29%3B%22%3E>

Pretty-printed this attack is easier to understand:

```html
<iframe src="javascript:xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
   xmlhttp.open('GET', 'http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=slurmCl4ssic&amp;repeat=slurmCl4ssic');
   xmlhttp.setRequestHeader('Authorization',`Bearer=${localStorage.getItem('token')}`);
   xmlhttp.send();">
</iframe>
```

Anyone who is logged in to the Juice Shop while clicking on this link
will get their password set to the same one we forced onto Bender!

:clap: Kudos to Joe Butler, who originally described this kind of CSRF
payload in his blog post
[Hacking(and automating!) the OWASP Juice Shop](https://incognitjoe.github.io/hacking-the-juice-shop.html).

### Dumpster dive the Internet for a leaked password and log in to the original user account it belongs to

:wrench: **TODO**

###  Perform an unwanted information disclosure by accessing data cross-domain

:wrench: **TODO**

### Retrieve the language file that never made it into production

1. Monitoring the HTTP calls to the backend when switching languages
   tells you how the translations are loaded:
   * <http://localhost:3000/i18n/en.json>
   * <http://localhost:3000/i18n/de_DE.json>
   * <http://localhost:3000/i18n/nl_NL.json>
   * <http://localhost:3000/i18n/zh_CN.json>
   * <http://localhost:3000/i18n/zh_HK.json>
   * etc.
2. It is obvious the language files are stored with the official
   _locale_ as name using underscore notation.
3. Nonetheless, even brute forcing all thinkable locale codes (`aa_AA`,
   `ab_AA`, ..., `zz_ZY`, `zz_ZZ`) would still **not** solve the
   challenge.
4. The hidden language is _Klingon_ which is represented by a
   three-letter code `tlh` with the dummy country code `AA`.
5. Request <http://localhost:3000/i18n/tlh_AA.json> to solve the
   challenge. majQa'!

Instead of expanding your brute force pattern (which is not a very
obvious decision to make) you can more easily find the solution to this
challenge by investigating which languages are supported in the Juice
Shop and how [the translations](../part3/translation.md) are managed.
This will quickly bring you over to
<https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop> which immediately
spoilers _Klingon_ as a supported language. Hovering over the
corresponding flag will eventually spoiler the language code `tlh_AA`.

![Crowdin Klingon Spoiler](img/crowdin_klingon-spoiler.png)

> of fictional aliens who inhabit the world of Star Trek, an American

> never existed, the Klingon language is real. It has developed from
> gibberish to a usable means of communication, complete with its own
> vocabulary, grammar, figures of speech, and even slang and regional
> dialects. Today it is spoken by humans all over the world, in many
> contexts.[^3]

### Forge an essentially unsigned JWT token

1. Log in as any user to receive a valid JWT in the `Authorization`
   header.
2. Copy the JWT (i.e. everything after `Bearer ` in the `Authorization`
   header) and decode it.
3. Under the `payload` property, change the `email` attribute in the
   JSON to `jwtn3d@juice-sh.op`.
4. Change the value of the `alg` property in the `header` part from
   `HS256` to `none`.
5. Encode the `header` to `base64url`. Similarly, encode the `payload`
   to `base64url`. *base64url makes it URL safe*, a regular Base64
   encode might not work!
6. Join the two strings obtained above with a `.` (dot symbol) and add a
   `.` at the end of the obtained string. So, effectively it becomes
   `base64url(header).base64url(payload).`
7. Change the `Authorization` header of a subsequent request to the
   retrieved JWT (prefixed with `Bearer ` as before) and submit the
   request. Alternatively you can set the `token` cookie to the JWT
   which be used to populate any future request with that header.

### Exploit OAuth 2.0 to log in with the Chief Information Security Officer's user account

1. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/login> and enter some known
   credentials.
2. Tick the _Remember me_ checkbox and _Log in_.
3. Inspecting the application cookies shows a new `email` cookie storing
   the plaintext email address.
4. _Log out_ and go back to <http://localhost:3000/#/login>. Make sure
   _Remember me_ is still ticked.
5. Using `ciso@juice-sh.op` as _Email_ and anything as _Password_
   perform a failed login attempt.
6. Inspecting the `email` cookie shows it was set to `ciso@juice-sh.op`
   even when login failed.
7. Inspecting any request being sent from now on you will notice a new
   custom HTTP header `X-User-Email: ciso@juice-sh.op`.
8. Now visit <http://localhost:3000/#/login> again, but this time choose
   the _Log in with Google_ button to log in with your own Google
   account.
9. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/contact> and check the _Author_ field
   to be surprised that you are logged in as `ciso@juice-sh.op` instead
   with your Google email address, because
   [the OAuth integration for login will accept the 'X-User-Email' header as gospel regardless of the account that just logged in](https://incognitjoe.github.io/hacking-the-juice-shop.html).

If you do not own a Google account to log in with or are running the
Juice Shop on a hostname that is not recognized, you can still solve
this challenge by logging in regularly but add `"oauth": true` to the
JSON payload `POST`ed to <http://localhost:3000/rest/user/login>.

###  All your orders are belong to us

:wrench: **TODO**

### Perform a Remote Code Execution that would keep a less hardened application busy forever

1. By manual or automated URL discovery you can find a
   [Swagger](https://swagger.io) API documentation hosted at
   <http://localhost:3000/api-docs> which describes the B2B API.

   ![Swagger API-Docs](img/swagger_api-docs.png)
2. This API allows to `POST` orders where the order lines can be sent as
   JSON objects (`orderLines`) but also as a String (`orderLinesData`).
3. The given example for `orderLinesDate` indicates that this String
   might be allowed to contain arbitrary JSON: `[{"productId":
   12,"quantity": 10000,"customerReference": ["PO0000001.2",
   "SM20180105|042"],"couponCode": "pes[Bh.u*t"},...]`

   ![Swagger Order Model](img/swagger_models-order.png)
4. Click the _Try it out_ button and without changing anything click
   _Execute_ to see if and how the API is working. This will give you a
   `401` error saying `No Authorization header was found`.
5. Go back to the application, log in as any user and copy your token
   from the `Authorization Bearer` header using your browser's DevTools.
6. Back at <http://localhost:3000/api-docs/#/Order/post_orders> click
   _Authorize_ and paste your token into the `Value` field.
7. Click _Try it out_ and _Execute_ to see a successful `200` response.
8. An insecure JSON deserialization would execute any function call
   defined within the JSON String, so a possible payload for a DoS
   attack would be an endless loop. Replace the example code with
   `{"orderLinesData": "(function dos() { while(true); })()"}` in the
   _Request Body_ field. Click _Execute_.
9. The server should eventually respond with a `200` after roughly 2
   seconds, because that is defined as a timeout so you do not really
   DoS your Juice Shop server.
10. If your request successfully bumped into the infinite loop
    protection, the challenge is marked as solved.

### Reset the password of Bjoern's internal account via the Forgot Password mechanism

1. Trying to find out who "Bjoern" might be should quickly lead you to
   the OWASP Juice Shop project leader and author of this ebook.
2. Visit https://www.facebook.com/bjoern.kimminich to immediately learn
   that he is from the town of _Uetersen_ in Germany.
3. Visit <https://gist.github.com/9045923> or
   <https://pastebin.com/JL5E0RfX> to find the source code of a (truly
   amazing) game Bjoern wrote in Turbo Pascal in 1995 (when he was a
   teenager) to learn his phone number area code of _04122_ which
   belongs to Uetersen. This is sufficient proof that you in fact are on
   the right track.
4. http://www.geopostcodes.com/Uetersen will tell you that Uetersen has
   ZIP code _25436_.
5. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
   `bjoern@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_.
6. In the subsequently appearing form, provide `25436` as _Your
   ZIP/postal code when you were a teenager?_
7. Type and _New Password_ and matching _Repeat New Password_ followed
   by hitting _Change_ to **not solve** this challenge.
8. Bjoern added some obscurity to his security answer by using an
   uncommon variant of the pre-unification format of
   [postal codes in Germany](#postal-codes-in-germany).
9. Visit http://www.alte-postleitzahlen.de/uetersen to learn that
   Uetersen's old ZIP code was `W-2082`. This would not work as an
   answer either. Bjoern used the written out variation: `West-2082`.
10. Change the answer to _Your ZIP/postal code when you were a
    teenager?_ into `West-2082` and click _Change_ again to finally
    solve this challenge.

#### Postal codes in Germany

> Postal codes in Germany, Postleitzahl (plural Postleitzahlen,
> abbreviated to PLZ; literally "postal routing number"), since 1 July
> 1993 consist of five digits. The first two digits indicate the wider
> area, the last three digits the postal district.
>
> Before reunification, both the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and
> the German Democratic Republic (GDR) used four-digit codes. Under a
> transitional arrangement following reunification, between 1989 and
> 1993 postal codes in the west were prefixed with 'W', e.g.: W-1000
> \[Berlin\] 30 (postal districts in western cities were separate from
> the postal code) and those in the east with 'O' (for Ost), e.g.:
> O-1xxx Berlin.[^4]

### Reset Morty's password via the Forgot Password mechanism

1. Trying to find out who "Morty" might be should _eventually_ lead you
   to _Morty Smith_ as the most likely user identity

   ![Morty Smith](img/Morty_Smith.jpg)
2. Visit http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Morty and skim through the
   [Family](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Morty#Family) section
3. It tells you that Morty had a dog named _Snuffles_ which also goes by
   the alias of _Snowball_ for a while.
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password and provide
   `morty@juice-sh.op` as your _Email_
5. Create a word list of all mutations (including typical
   "leet-speak"-variations!) of the strings `snuffles` and `snowball`
   using only
   * lower case (`a-z`)
   * upper case (`A-Z`)
   * and digit characters (`0-9`)
6. Write a script that iterates over the word list and sends well-formed
   requests to `http://localhost:3000/rest/user/reset-password`. A rate
   limiting mechanism will prevent you from sending more than 100
   requests within 5 minutes, severely hampering your brute force
   attack.
7. Change your script so that it provides a different
   `X-Forwarded-For`-header in each request, as this takes precedence
   over the client IP in determining the origin of a request.
8. Rerun your script you will notice at some point that the answer to
   the security question is `5N0wb41L` and the challenge is marked as
   solved.
9. Feel free to cancel the script execution at this point.

### Deprive the shop of earnings by downloading the blueprint for one of its products

1. The description of the _OWASP Juice Shop Logo (3D-printed)_ product
   indicates that this product might actually have kind of a blueprint
2. Download the product image from
   http://localhost:3000/public/images/products/3d_keychain.jpg and view
   its [Exif metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)

   ![3D printed logo Exif metadata](img/exif-3d_keychain.png)
3. Researching the camera model entry _OpenSCAD_ reveals that this is a
   program to create 3D models, which works with `.stl` files
4. As no further hint on the blueprint filename or anything is given, a
   lucky guess or brute force attack is your only choice
5. Download http://localhost:3000/public/images/products/JuiceShop.stl
   to solve this challenge
6. This model will actually allow you to 3D-print your own OWASP Juice
   Shop logo models!

   ![JuiceShop.stl Surface Angle view](img/JuiceShop.stl_surface.png)
   ![JuiceShop.stl Wireframe view](img/JuiceShop.stl_wireframe.png)

The official place to retrieve this and other media or artwork files
from the Juice Shop (and other OWASP projects or chapters) is
<https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-swag>. There you can not only find the
3D model leaked from this challenge, but also
[one that comes with a dedicated hole to mount it on your keyring](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-swag/blob/master/projects/juice-shop/3d/JuiceShop_KeyChain.stl)!

### Inform the development team about a danger to some of their credentials

1. Solve
   [Access a developer's forgotten backup file](#access-a-developers-forgotten-backup-file)
2. The `package.json.bak` contains not only runtime dependencies but
   also development dependencies under the `devDependencies` section.
3. Go through the list of `devDependencies` and perform research on
   vulnerabilities in them which would allow a Software Supply Chain
   Attack.
4. For the `eslint-scope` module you will learn about one such incident
   exactly in the pinned version `3.7.2`, e.g.
   <https://status.npmjs.org/incidents/dn7c1fgrr7ng> or
   <https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes>
5. Both above links refer to the original report of this vulnerability
   on GitHub: <https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39>
6. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/contact>
7. Submit your feedback with
   `https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39` in the comment to
   solve this challenge

### Inform the shop about a more sneaky instance of typosquatting it fell for

1. Request <http://localhost:3000/3rdpartylicenses.txt> to retrieve the
   3rd party license list generated by Angular CLI by default
2. Combing through the list of modules you will come across
   `ng2-bar-rating` which openly reveals its intent on
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-bar-rating

   ![epilogue-js on NPM](img/npm_ng2-bar-rating.png)
3. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/contact>
4. Submit your feedback with `ng2-bar-rating` in the comment to solve
   this challenge

You can probably imagine that the typosquatted `ng2-bar-rating` would be
_a lot harder_ to distinguish from the original repository
`ngx-bar-rating`, if it where not marked with the _THIS IS **NOT** THE
MODULE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!_-warning at the very top. Below you can see
the original `ngx-bar-rating` module page on NPM:

![ngx-bar-rating on NPM](img/npm_ngx-bar-rating.png)

### Give the server something to chew on for quite a while

1. Solve the
   [Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down](#use-a-deprecated-b2b-interface-that-was-not-properly-shut-down)
   challenge.
2. On Linux, prepare an XML file which defines and uses an external
   entity which will require a long time to resolve: `<!ENTITY xxe
   SYSTEM "file:///dev/random">`. On Windows there is no similar feature
   to retrieve randomness from the OS via an "endless" file, so the
   attack vector has to be completely different. A _quadratic blowup_
   attack works fine, consisting of a single large entity like `<!ENTITY
   a "dosdosdosdos...dos"`> which is replicated very often as in
   `<foo>&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;...&a;</foo>`.
3. Upload this file through the _File Complaint_ dialog and observe how
   the request processing takes up to 2 seconds and then times out (to
   prevent you from actually DoS'ing your application) but still solving
   the challenge.

_You might feel tempted to try the classic **Billion laughs attack** but
will quickly notice that the XML parser is hardened against it, giving
you a status `410` HTTP error saying `Detected an entity reference
loop`._

## Diabolic Challenges (  :star::star::star::star::star::star:  )

###  Overwrite the Legal Information file

1. Combing through the updates of the
   [@owasp_juiceshop](https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop) Twitter
   account you will notice
   <https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop/status/1107781073575002112>.

   ![Tweet advertising ZIP uploads in "File Complaint"](img/tweet_zip-complaints.png)
2. Researching ZIP-based vulnerabilities should also yield
   [Zip Slip](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability) which
   exploits directory traversal filenames in file archives.
3. As the Legal Information file you need to override lives in
   <http://localhost:3000/ftp/legal.md> and uploading files via _File
   Complaint_ does not give any feedback where they are stored, an
   iterative directory traversal approach is recommended.
4. Prepare a ZIP file (on Linux) with `zip exploit.zip ../ftp/legal.md`.
5. Log in as any user at <http://localhost:3000/#/login>.
6. Click _Contact Us_ and _Complain?_ to get to the _File Complaint_
   screen at <http://localhost:3000/#/complain>.
7. Type in any message and attach your ZIP file, then click _Submit_.
8. The challenge will _not_ be solved. Repeat steps 5-7 but with `zip
   exploit.zip ../../ftp/legal.md` as the payload.
9. The challenge will be marked as solved! When you visit
   <http://localhost:3000/ftp/legal.md> you will see your overwritten
   Legal Information!

> Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by
> extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory
> traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts
> of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should
> reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either
> invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus
> achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The
> vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files
> or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client
> (user) machines and servers. [^8]

### Forge a coupon code that gives you a discount of at least 80%

For this challenge there are actually two distinct _solution paths_ that
are both viable. These will be explained separately as they utilize
totally different attack styles.

#### _Pattern analysis_ solution path

1. Solve challenge
   [Access a salesman's forgotten backup file](#access-a-salesmans-forgotten-backup-file)
   to get the `coupons_2013.md.bak` file with old coupon codes which you
   find listed below.
2. There is an obvious pattern in the last characters, as the first
   eleven codes end with `gC7sn` and the last with `gC7ss`.
3. You can rightfully speculate that the last five characters represent
   the actual discount value. The change in the last character for the
   12th code comes from a different (probably higher) discount in
   December! :santa:
4. Check the official Juice Shop Twitter account for a valid coupon
   code: <https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop>
5. At the time of this writing - January 2017 - the broadcasted coupon
   was `n<Mibh.u)v` promising a 50% discount.
6. Assuming that the discount value is encoded in the last 2-5
   characters of the code, you could now start a trial-end-error or
   brute force attack generating codes and try redeeming them on the
   _Your Basket_ page. At some point you will probably hit one that
   gives 80% or more discount.
7. You need to _Checkout_ after redeeming your code to solve the
   challenge.

```
 n<MibgC7sn
 mNYS#gC7sn
 o*IVigC7sn
 k#pDlgC7sn
 o*I]pgC7sn
 n(XRvgC7sn
 n(XLtgC7sn
 k#*AfgC7sn
 q:<IqgC7sn
 pEw8ogC7sn
 pes[BgC7sn
 l}6D$gC7ss
```

#### _Reverse engineering_ solution path

1. Going through the dependencies mentioned in `package.json.bak` you
   can speculate that at least one of them could be involved in the
   coupon code generation.
2. Narrowing the dependencies down to crypto or hashing libraries you
   would end up with `hashids`, `jsonwebtoken` and `z85` as candidates.
3. It turns out that `z85`
   ([ZeroMQ Base-85 Encoding](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32/Z85/)) was
   chosen as the coupon code-creation algorithm.
4. Visit <https://www.npmjs.com/package/z85> and check the _Dependents_
   tab:

   ![Dependents of z85 on npmjs.com](img/z85-dependents.png)
5. If you have Node.js installed locally run `npm install -g z85-cli` to
   install <https://www.npmjs.com/package/z85-cli> - a simple command
   line interface for `z85`:

   ![z85-cli page on npmjs.com](img/z85-cli.png)
6. Check the official Juice Shop Twitter account
   <https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop> for a valid coupon code. At the
   time of this writing - January 2017 - the broadcasted coupon was
   `n<Mibh.u)v` promising a 50% discount.

   ![Coupon Code for January 2017 on @owasp_juiceshop](/appendix/img/coupon_code-january2017.png)
7. Decrypting this code with `z85 -d "n<Mibh.u)v"` returns `JAN17-50`
8. Encrypt a code valid for the current month with 80% or more discount,
   e.g. `z85 -e JAN17-80` which yields `n<Mibh.v0y`.
9. Enter and redeem the generated code on the _Your Basket_ page and
   _Checkout_ to solve the challenge.

#### _Cloud computing_ solution path

1. From February 2019 onward the monthly coupon tweets begin with a
   robot face emoji in square brackets. Maybe the Juice Shop sales team
   forgot to send coupons too often so that the process was automated at
   some point?

   ![Coupon tweeted by a bot](img/coupon_tweet_bot.png)
2. Some Internet research will bring you to the
   [NPM module `juicy-coupon-bot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juicy-coupon-bot)
   and its associated GitHub repository
   <https://github.com/bkimminich/juicy-coupon-bot>.
   :information_source: _As this is not part of the Juice Shop repo
   itself and it is publicly accessible, analyzing this repository is
   **not** considered cheating!_
3. Open the `.travis.yml` to see how the bot's CI/CD process is set up.
   You can also look at the job results and logs at
   <https://travis-ci.org/bkimminich/juicy-coupon-bot>.
4. You will realize that there is a `deploy` step that is only executed
   when the build was triggered by a (monthly) cron job on Travis-CI.
   This is probably the origin of the monthly tweets! But where does the
   bot get its coupon code from?
5. Read the code of the `juicy-coupon-bot` carefully and optionally try
   to play with it locally after installing it via `npm i -g
   juicy-coupon-bot`. You can learn a few things that way:
   * Running `juicy-coupon-bot` locally will
     [prepare the text for a tweet with a coupon code](https://github.com/bkimminich/juicy-coupon-bot/blob/master/lib/statusText.js)
     for the current month and with a discount between 10% and 40% and
     log it to your console.
   * The coupon code is actually retrieved
     [via an AWS API call](https://5j4d1u7jhf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/default/JuicyCouponFunc)
     which returns valid coupons with different discounts and their
     expiration date as JSON, e.g.
     `{"discountCodes":{"10%":"mNYS#iv#%t","20%":"mNYS#iw00u","30%":"mNYS#iw03v","40%":"mNYS#iw06w"},"expiryDate":"2019-02-28"}`
6. You could collect this data for several months and basically fall
   back to the
   [Pattern analysis solution path](#pattern-analysis-solution-path)
   only with more recent coupons.
7. For an easier and more satisfying victory over this challenge, take a
   look at the commit history of the GitHub repository
   <https://github.com/bkimminich/juicy-coupon-bot>, though.
8. Going back in time a bit, you will learn that the coupon retrieval
   via AWS API backed by a Lambda function was not the original
   implementation. Commit
   [`fde2003`](https://github.com/bkimminich/juicy-coupon-bot/commit/fde2003535598ad3c4edc17ad9ffcdc9c589d3c5)
   introduced the API call, replacing the previous programmatic creation
   of a coupon code.

   ![Diff of local and cloud-based coupon creation](img/git-diff_coupon_lambda.png)
9. You now have learned the coupon format and that it is `z85` encoded.
   You can now either manipulate your local clone of the "pre-`fde2003`
   version" of the `juicy-coupon-bot` or fall back to the last part of
   the
   [Reverse engineering solution path](#reverse-engineering-solution-path)
   where you find and install `z85-cli` to conveniently create your own
   80%+ coupon locally.

### Solve challenge #999

1. Solve any other challenge
2. Inspect the cookies in your browser to find a `continueCode` cookie
3. The `package.json.bak` contains the library used for generating these
   continue codes: `hashid`
4. Visit <http://hashids.org/> to get some information about the
   mechanism
5. Follow the link labeled _check out the demo_
   (<http://codepen.io/ivanakimov/pen/bNmExm>)
6. The Juice Shop simply uses the example salt (`this is my salt`) and
   also the default character range
   (`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890`)
   from that demo page. It just uses a minimum length of `60` instead of
   `8` for the resulting hash.
7. Encoding the value `999` with the demo (see code below) gives you the
   hash result
   `69OxrZ8aJEgxONZyWoz1Dw4BvXmRGkM6Ae9M7k2rK63YpqQLPjnlb5V5LvDj`
8. Send a `PUT` request to the URL
   <http://localhost:3000/rest/continue-code/apply/69OxrZ8aJEgxONZyWoz1Dw4BvXmRGkM6Ae9M7k2rK63YpqQLPjnlb5V5LvDj>
   to solve this challenge.

```javascript
   var hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt", 60, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890");

  var id = hashids.encode(999);
  var numbers = hashids.decode(id);

  $("#input").text("["+numbers.join(", ")+"]");
  $("#output").text(id);
```

### Forge an almost properly RSA-signed JWT token

1. Use your favorite forced directory browsing tool (or incredible
   guessing luck) to identify <http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys> as
   having directory listing enabled.
2. Download the application's public JWT key from
   <http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys/jwt.pub>

   ![encryption keys](img/jwt2-findkey.PNG)
3. Download and install the
   [Burp Suite Community Edition](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)
4. In the _BApp Store_ tab under the _Extender_ tab within Burp Suite
   find and install the
   [JSON Web Token Attacker](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/82d6c60490b540369d6d5d01822bdf61)
   extension (aka _JOSEPH_)

   ![load extension](img/jwt2-burpextension.PNG)
5. Send any captured request that has an `Authorization: Bearer` token
   to Burp's _Repeater_.
6. Once in _Repeater_, click the _JWS_ tab, then the _Payload_ tab
   beneath and modify the email parameter to be `rsa_lord@juice-sh.op`.

   ![modify payload](img/jwt2-request.PNG)
7. Next, click the _Attacker_ tab, select _Key Confusion_, then click
   _Load_.
8. Paste in the contents of the `jwt.pub` file without the `-----BEGIN
   RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` lines.

   ![key confusion](img/jwt2-keyconfusion.PNG)
9. Click _Update_ and then _Go_ in the top left to send the modified
   request via Burp and solve this challenge!

:clap: Kudos to [Tyler Rosonke](https://github.com/ZonkSec) for
providing this solution.

###  Like any review at least three times as the same user

:wrench: **TODO**

### Log in with the support team's original user credentials

_Solving this challenge requires [KeePass 2.x](http://keepass.info)
installed on your computer. If you are using a non-Windows OS you need
to use some unofficial port._

1. Download and install KeePass 2.x from <http://keepass.info>
2. Get the support team's KeePass database file from
   <http://localhost:3000/ftp/incident-support.kdbx> (note how this file
   is conveniently _not blocked_ by the file type filter).
3. Inspecting `main.js` for information leakage (e.g. by searching for
   `support`) will yield an interesting log statement that is printed
   when the support logs in with the wrong password:

   ![Support team login hint in minified JS](/appendix/img/minified-js_support-hint.png)
4. The logged text is in Romanian language: `<!-- @echipa de suport:
   Secretul nostru comun este încă Caoimhe cu parola de master gol! -->`
5. Running this through an online translator yields something like:
   `Support Team: Our secret is still common Caoimhe master password
   empty!`
6. From `master password empty` you can derive, that the KeePass file is
   protected with **only a key file** instead of a password!
7. The key file must be something the support team has easy access to
   from everywhere - how else would they achieve 24/7 with expectedly
   high staff rotation?
8. The second important hint is the reference to `Caoimhe`, which
   happens to be an Irish feminine given name.
9. Visit <http://localhost:3000/#/about> and cycle through the photos of
   all support staff that are displayed in the background feedback
   carousel. There is one woman with red hair, which is a
   (stereo-)typical attribute of Irish people - so maybe she actually
   _is_ "Caoimhe"?

   ![Photo of Caoimhe in About Use carousel](img/caoimhe.png)
10. Download the photo
    <http://localhost:3000/public/images/carousel/6.jpg> and use it as a
    key file to unlock the KeePass database.
11. Find the password for the support team user account in the `prod`
    entry of the KeePass file.

    ![Unlocked KeePass file](img/keepass-list.png)
12. Log in with `support@juice-sh.op` as _Email_ and
    `J6aVjTgOpRs$?5l+Zkq2AYnCE@RF§P` as _Password_ to beat this
    challenge.

    ![Credentials of the support team in the KeePass file](img/keepass-prod_entry.png)

### Unlock Premium Challenge to access exclusive content

1. Inspecting the HTML source of the corresponding row in the _Score
   Board_ table reveals a HTML comment that is obviously encrypted:
   `<!--IvLuRfBJYlmStf9XfL6ckJFngyd9LfV1JaaN/KRTPQPidTuJ7FR+D/nkWJUF+0xUF07CeCeqYfxq+OJVVa0gNbqgYkUNvn//UbE7e95C+6e+7GtdpqJ8mqm4WcPvUGIUxmGLTTAC2+G9UuFCD1DUjg==-->`.

   ![DOM inspection of the Unlock Premium Challenge button](img/inspect-premium_challenge.png)
2. This is a cipher text that came out of an AES-encryption using AES256
   in CBC mode.
3. To get the key and the IV, you should run a _Forced Directory
   Browsing_ attack against the application. You can use OWASP ZAP for
   this purpose.
   1. Of the word lists coming with OWASP ZAP only
      `directory-list-2.3-big.txt` and
      `directory-list-lowercase-2.3-big.txt` contain the directory with
      the key file.
   2. The search will uncover <http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys> as
      a browsable directory

      ![Browsable directoy "encryptionkeys"](img/encryptionkeys_directory.png)
   3. Open <http://localhost:3000/encryptionkeys/premium.key> to
      retrieve the AES encryption key `EA99A61D92D2955B1E9285B55BF2AD42`
      and the IV `1337`.
4. In order to decrypt the cipher text, it is best to use `openssl`.
   - `echo
     "IvLuRfBJYlmStf9XfL6ckJFngyd9LfV1JaaN/KRTPQPidTuJ7FR+D/nkWJUF+0xUF07CeCeqYfxq+OJVVa0gNbqgYkUNvn//UbE7e95C+6e+7GtdpqJ8mqm4WcPvUGIUxmGLTTAC2+G9UuFCD1DUjg=="
     | openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -K EA99A61D92D2955B1E9285B55BF2AD42
     -iv 1337133713371337 -a -A`
   - The plain text is:
     `/this/page/is/hidden/behind/an/incredibly/high/paywall/that/could/only/be/unlocked/by/sending/1btc/to/us`
5. Visit
   <http://localhost:3000/this/page/is/hidden/behind/an/incredibly/high/paywall/that/could/only/be/unlocked/by/sending/1btc/to/us>
   to solve this challenge and marvel at the premium VR wallpaper!
   (Requires dedicated hardware to be viewed in all its glory.)

### Perform a Remote Code Execution that occupies the server for a while without using infinite loops

1. Follow steps 1-7 of the challenge
   [Perform a Remote Code Execution that would keep a less hardened application busy forever](#perform-a-remote-code-execution-that-would-keep-a-less-hardened-application-busy-forever).
2. As _Request Body_ put in `{"orderLinesData":
   "/((a+)+)b/.test('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')"}` - which will
   trigger a very costly Regular Expression test once executed.
3. Submit the request by clicking _Execute_.
4. The server should eventually respond with a `503` status and an error
   stating `Sorry, we are temporarily not available! Please try again
   later.` after roughly 2 seconds. This is due to a defined timeout so
   you do not really DoS your Juice Shop server.
